# MiniCalculator
My unit tests are testing the multiply, divide and calculate methods. To test multiply, I used 10 to check the result.
If the result was 10 then it was successful, if not it failed. For divide, since the total is now 10, I used 5 as 
the divisor and if 2 was the result it was succesful, if not it failed. To test calculate I used zero. Since in multiply 
and divide there isn't a zero, if both are calculated correctly, calculate won't produce a zero.
